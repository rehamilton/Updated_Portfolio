The below covers some of the styling used during creation.

## Theme
- The main theme was created by choosing my main photo and colouring everything else in the site around it. 

## Contacts
- I used fontawesome to get some social media icons relating to my contact me.
- I left the email as text only for the moment.

## Footer
- I wanted the footer to stay at the bottom of the site

## Media Queries
- Media queries were used to solve minor formatting issues that weren't already dealt with through responsive bootstrap classes

## Issues
- I started to style using Bulma but found the framework too limiting and had to change to bootstrap half waythrough.

## Github
- My profile within github was updated to show as much information as I was happy to have in the public domain.
- I have always used pins but updated them to include this project.

## LinkedIn
- I have been keeping my LinkedIn updated as I have been job searching recently.

## CV
- I also updated my CV recently so have attached this.
